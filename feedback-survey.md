# âœ… DevEx Feedback Survey

Purpose: Understand how the Developer Experience initiative is improving workflows, reducing friction, and increasing satisfaction.

We should:

- allow both anonymous and identified submissions,
- include a feedback summary in our DevEx demo days or Slack channel for transparency.
